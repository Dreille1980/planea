### Question 1: What is the purchase flow within your app once the free trial period has expired?

**RESPONSE TO COPY:**

```
After the 7-day free trial expires, users are presented with a subscription paywall that offers two options:

1. Monthly subscription - recurring monthly billing
2. Annual subscription - recurring yearly billing with savings compared to monthly

The purchase flow works as follows:

1. When attempting to use premium features after trial expiration, users see a subscription screen displaying both subscription options with clear pricing
2. Users select their preferred subscription plan (monthly or annual)
3. Purchase is completed entirely through Apple's in-app purchase system (StoreKit 2)
4. No external payment methods or websites are used - all transactions go through the App Store
5. After successful purchase, users immediately gain access to all premium features:
   - Unlimited meal plan generation
   - Personalized recipe recommendations
   - Family profile management
   - Shopping list creation
   - Recipe favorites and history

6. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled by the user
7. Users can manage/cancel subscriptions through iOS Settings ‚Üí [User Name] ‚Üí Subscriptions, or directly in the app through Settings ‚Üí Subscription ‚Üí Manage Subscription

All subscription management follows Apple's standard in-app purchase guidelines, with no alternative payment mechanisms.
```

### Question 2: Demo Account with Expired Free Trial

**RESPONSE TO COPY:**

```
To facilitate testing of the app's subscription flow, we have implemented an App Review access system.

**Testing Method: Developer Access Code**

Access Code: PLANEA_FAMILY_2025

This access code grants full app functionality without requiring payment, allowing the review team to test all features including the subscription flow.

**How to use the code:**
1. Download and install Planea from TestFlight or the review build
2. Complete the onboarding process
3. Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí [Look for Developer Access or similar option]
4. Enter the code: PLANEA_FAMILY_2025
5. The app will grant full access to all premium features

This implementation allows the review team to:
- Test the app with full functionality
- Verify the subscription paywall appears correctly for non-subscribed users
- Test the purchase flow through Apple's sandbox environment
- Validate all premium features work as intended

**Alternative Testing:**
If preferred, you can also test with a standard Apple Sandbox test account:
- Create a Sandbox tester in App Store Connect
- The 7-day trial can be accelerated in sandbox mode
- After trial expiration, the subscription paywall will appear as it does for regular users

**Note:** The developer access code system is used solely for review and testing purposes and is not accessible to regular users. It simulates a subscribed state to allow thorough feature testing without time constraints.
